# What is CV?

A field trying to develop computer algorithms that ***see***.


## How to check if a vision system is working?

- Visual question answering
    - show it an image and ask questions about it
- Benchmarking

## Does CV mimic human Vision

Not yet. But that is one of its goals.
Human vision system is not very efficient (illusions, etc). So mimicing it completely mightnot make sense.

> Take inspiration wherever convenient

- Gestalt Principles

# Three *urges* on seeing a picture

- Re-organization
    - Group proximate and similar parts into meaningful regions
- Recognition
    - Recollect previously seen objects from memory
- Reconstruction
    - Measure quantitative aspects: Number, Size, Distance, etc

# Applications

- Space imaging
- Medical Fields
- Biometrics
- Broadcasting
    - Hawkeye
    - Chroma keying
- Multi-camera stereo, structure recovery
- Virtualized/Augemented Reality
- Natural Gaming (example: Microsoft Kinnect)

# Why do we need an automated vision system?

Efficient than human for some niche. A general all-purpose vision system won't do well.
