- ImageNet
    - CNNs take off (Alexnet, 2012)
    - *Net* comes from WordNet (heirarchy of word classes. Similarly, we have hierarchy of classes (example dog) in ImageNet).

- Filter vs convolution
    - Filter: Relates pixels to each other. For example, Gaussian filter will relate the middle pixel to the neighbouring pixels.


# MLPs

- Not easy for MLPs to learn invariance
    - Example if a cat moves, an MLP will have difficulty in explaining that
    - SIFT doesn't have a problem with this.
- even harder to learn equivariance

# Convolution (output size)

- input size 
- kernel size
- stride
- padding
- multiple channels

# Inputs & Outputs

- Input image: `B x C_in x H_in x W_in`
    - Batch B, Multi-channeling processing C_in, and height and width

- Receptive field
    - Effective area "seen" by a neuron
