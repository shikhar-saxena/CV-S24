We want the aperture to be ideal (small/large both are bad).

# Object size vs Object motion vs Camera motion

The position of the image captured depends on the height of the camera (and where it's placed compared to the object).


**Problem: Person who is 1.75m tall standing at 7m from camera. Pinhole camera has focal length of 20mm. The sensor is 1cm tall and has a resolution of 4000x3000. Find the height of the person in pixels in the image.**

Using similar triangle concepts: 

$$
\frac{1.75}{x} = \frac{7000}{20}
$$ 

$\implies x = 0.5$ cm

The aperture covered (from center to bottom): bottom half. The image completely fits on the sensor.

*Convention*: WxH resolution usually. Given, height of the sensor is 1cm (which will be $3000$ pixels). So 0.5cm will be $1500$ pixels.

**If we raise the camera by 1m, how much does the person move in the sensor (in pixels)?**

The person in the image will start going from bottom half to top half. This can be calculated. Say we move $1.75/2$ m up then the image will be at the center of the sensor for example.


**How much does the sun move in the above case. Note: Sun is 150 million kms away (in pixels)?**

Zero. This is because the object is so far away that the light coming in is parallel.


# Coordinate System

- $[X, Y, Z]$: World coordinate system
    - This assumes a frame of reference (origin)
- $[x, y]$: Image coordinate system
- Camera model: a function that maps world coordinates to image coordinates
    - This function is not one-to-one. But many-to-one mapping.
- Perspective mapping: How the many-to-one mapping is achieved.

## Transformations: 3D Translation

Linear Transformation: $X' = TX$ 

Having an extra dimension accounts for homogeneous coordinate system. Projective space becomes the 4th dimension. Adding a 4th dimension makes it easier to compute translation essentially. And you can easily get back to cartesian coordinate system.


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X'\\
Y'\\
Z'\\
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
X + d_x\\
Y + d_y\\
Z + d_z
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

## Scaling

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X'\\
Y'\\
Z'\\
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
X \ S_x\\
Y \ S_y\\
Z \ S_z
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

## Rotation (around z-axis)

$X = R \cos \phi$ and $Y = R \sin \phi$.

$X' = R \cos (\phi + \theta)$ and $Y' = R \sin (\phi + \theta)$ 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X'\\
Y'\\
Z'\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0\\
    \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z 
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

We can also rotate arbitrarily. We'll have angles of rotations along each axis then. Order of Rotation is important because they are not permutation-insensitive. Rotate x in one axis then y in another will end up in a different position than say y in other axis then x in the first axis.

# Cartesian $\leftrightarrow$ Homogeneous coordinates

Add a new dimension:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X\\
Y\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
kX \\
kY \\
k 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Getting back to cartesian:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
X\\
Y\\
w\\
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
X/w \\
Y/w 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
